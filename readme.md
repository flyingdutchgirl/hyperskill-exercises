This project contains most of my Hyperskill tasks solutions (Java tracks).

There are stand-alone tasks that were a part of some lessons. The complete Hyperskill projects I finished can be found in separate github repositories.
For some reason, some of the files are blank (contain only a template code and no solution) - it happens particularly often in Topics directory. Other files can contain solutions that are incorrect. Caution is advised.

All solutions are mine but the exercises and their .html and .yaml descriptions were created by Hyperskill.
